### Question:

Is it more efficient to have gotten all data on case manager's clients when the page loads or only get data upon request??

### Layout

So far I have a sidebar with clients and a main card next to it where the client's data will be displayed.
Bare Bones layouts completed

I now have fake data that displays names of clients phone numbers and ids.

Mass Message is a modal that pops up to display all clients with radio buttons that allow the user to select All clients or specific clients to send a mass message to

### INFO

To view each page type the route in
/dash
/login
/connect

### BUGS

Trouble getting my checkIns to display on dash
I think what is happening is that when there is no client selected it doesn't know what to do and breaks
I am not currently starting with a cleint selected. I could try to do that and see if there is any change
