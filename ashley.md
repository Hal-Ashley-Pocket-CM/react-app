### Question:

Is it more efficient to have gotten all data on case manager's clients when the page loads or only get data upon request??

### Layout

So far I have a sidebar with clients and a main card next to it where the client's data will be displayed.

### INFO

To view each page type the route in
/dash
/login
/connect
